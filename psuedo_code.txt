Pseudocode: End-to-End ELT Pipeline for ML Training Data
Overall Architecture Components & Their Purpose:
Amazon S3:

s3://your-bucket/raw-json-data/: Landing zone for original JSONs (historical & incremental).

s3://your-bucket/raw-json-data-processed/: Destination for moved original JSONs after successful processing (for audit/archive).

s3://your-bucket/curated-data-lake/json_parsed_parquet/: Optimized, partitioned Parquet output for ML training.

s3://your-bucket/error-data-lake/json_malformed_records/: Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for corrupt/unparsable JSON records.

Amazon RDS PostgreSQL:

file_processing_status table: Central ledger for tracking the processing status of every raw JSON file.

AWS Glue Workflow: Orchestrates the sequence and triggers of Glue Jobs.

AWS Glue Jobs:

FileListerAndDbPopulator: Discovers raw JSONs and populates RDS.

JsonToParquetBatchProcessor: The core ELT job. Reads batches, transforms, writes Parquet, moves raw files, updates RDS.

AWS Glue Trigger: Schedules the JsonToParquetBatchProcessor job.

AWS Glue Data Catalog: Manages metadata and schema for the Parquet data.

S3 Lifecycle Policies: Automates archiving of processed raw JSONs.

CloudWatch / SNS: Monitoring and alerting.

Pseudocode: ELT Workflow & Job Details
I. AWS Glue Workflow: JsonToParquetProcessingWorkflow
This defines the overall orchestration.

Job: FileListerAndDbPopulator

Trigger: Manual (for initial historical load) or Scheduled (e.g., daily/weekly for new YYYY/weekXX folders).

Action: Executes the FileListerAndDbPopulator Glue Job (see function below).

Success Path: Leads to (conceptually) the BatchProcessorScheduler to begin/continue processing.

Trigger: BatchProcessorScheduler

Type: Scheduled Trigger (e.g., every 15 minutes).

Action: Starts the JsonToParquetBatchProcessor Glue Job.

Condition: Always fires on schedule; JsonToParquetBatchProcessor handles "no work to do" gracefully.

Job: JsonToParquetBatchProcessor

Trigger: Activated by BatchProcessorScheduler.

Action: Executes the JsonToParquetBatchProcessor Glue Job (see function below).

Error Handling (Workflow Level): If this job fails (e.g., crashes due to OOM, unhandled exception), the Glue Workflow records the failure. The BatchProcessorScheduler will simply attempt to run it again on the next schedule, and the JsonToParquetBatchProcessor job's internal logic (querying for PENDING or FAILED files) will ensure it picks up any unfinished or problematic work.

II. Glue Job Definition: FileListerAndDbPopulator (PySpark/Python Shell)
Purpose: Scans S3 raw data locations, identifies all JSON files, and registers their initial PENDING status in the RDS PostgreSQL tracking table.

Yes, it's possible for an AWS Glue ETL job to automatically create or update a Glue Data Catalog table. However, the exact mechanism and best practices depend on how you're writing the data within your PySpark script.

There are two primary ways a Glue job interacts with the Data Catalog for table creation/updates:

Using glueContext.write_dynamic_frame.from_catalog() or from_options() with catalog info (Glue's native DynamicFrames API):

This is Glue's preferred way for tight integration.

When you use glueContext.write_dynamic_frame.from_catalog() and specify a catalogTableName and catalogDatabase, Glue will automatically create the table in the Data Catalog if it doesn't exist, or update its schema if enableUpdateCatalog=True is set and schema changes are detected. It's designed to manage partitions as well.

The from_options() method can also be used with catalog_connection_options to specify catalog details.

This is the most "automatic" way.

Using Spark's DataFrame API (.write.saveAsTable() or .write.parquet() with awswrangler):

dataframe.write.saveAsTable("database_name.table_name"): If you use Spark's saveAsTable() method within a Glue PySpark job (and your Glue job's IAM role has sufficient permissions), Spark will automatically create the table in the Glue Data Catalog (since Glue's backend is compatible with Hive Metastore) based on the DataFrame's schema. It will also manage partitions. If the table already exists, it will try to append or overwrite based on the mode().

Schema Evolution: This method generally handles schema evolution (adding new columns) automatically, reflecting the union of schemas in the Data Catalog. However, for complex or incompatible type changes, it might still require manual intervention or a crawler.

awswrangler library: This is a popular Pandas-on-AWS library that simplifies many data operations, including writing Parquet to S3 and integrating with Glue Data Catalog.

awswrangler.s3.to_parquet(df=spark_df.toPandas(), ..., database="db_name", table="table_name", dataset=True, mode="append", schema_evolution=True)

The schema_evolution=True parameter specifically tells awswrangler (and by extension, Glue) to manage schema changes in the Data Catalog. This is a very clean way to achieve it.

Recommendation for Your Use Case:
Given your architecture (PySpark, Parquet, schema evolution, partitioning), I recommend using one of these two approaches:

dataframe.write.saveAsTable("your_database_name.your_table_name")

This is often the simplest and most direct way to create/update Glue Data Catalog tables from a Spark DataFrame.

Ensure your Glue job's IAM role has permissions like glue:CreateTable, glue:UpdateTable, glue:GetTable, glue:GetPartitions, glue:CreatePartition, glue:UpdatePartition for the specific database and table in the Data Catalog.

awswrangler.s3.to_parquet() with catalog parameters:

If you find saveAsTable doesn't provide enough control or you prefer the awswrangler ecosystem, this is a very robust alternative.

How Schema Evolution is Handled by Glue Data Catalog (Revisited):
Regardless of the method you choose to create/update the table (saveAsTable or GlueContext API), the Glue Data Catalog's schema evolution works like this:

Union of Schemas: When new data is written to the same S3 location with mergeSchema=True (as you correctly planned for Parquet writes) and the Glue table is configured to automatically update (or a crawler is run), the Data Catalog will reflect the union of all schemas it encounters.

New Columns: If new columns appear in later data, they will be added to the Data Catalog table definition. Older data (which doesn't have these columns) will appear as NULL when queried.

Compatible Type Changes: If a column's type changes compatibly (e.g., INT to BIGINT/LONG, FLOAT to DOUBLE), the Data Catalog will update the column to the broader type.

Incompatible Type Changes: This is still the trickiest. If a column's type changes incompatibly (e.g., STRING to STRUCT), it might lead to NULL values for the conflicting type, or in some cases, the table update might fail if the change is too drastic. This typically requires a custom handling strategy (like creating a new column, or more complex schema migration).

In Summary:
Yes, when files are processed by a Glue job that writes to S3 and is configured to integrate with the Glue Data Catalog (either via glueContext.write_dynamic_frame.from_catalog/from_options or Spark's saveAsTable or awswrangler.s3.to_parquet), the Glue Data Catalog table will be automatically created and its schema will evolve to accommodate new columns and compatible type changes. This eliminates the need for manual table creation or running separate crawlers for schema discovery on each ETL run if the job is set up correctly.
